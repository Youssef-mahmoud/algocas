      "\n",
      "• The European Central Bank (ECB) has kept interest rates steady at 4% for the third consecutive meeting, citing concerns about inflation and global economic pressures.\n",
      "• ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasized that rate cuts are not yet on the table, but will depend heavily on future data and inflation trends, which remain above the 2% target.\n",
      "• Despite caution from the ECB, analysts predict possible rate reductions later this year as the eurozone economy shows signs of weakening, with slowing GDP growth and reduced industrial output in key member states like Germany and Italy.\n",
      "• Small business owners across the EU are concerned about borrowing costs, claiming that sustained high interest rates are stifling investment and job creation.\n",

      "📄 Summary 2:\n",
      "Here are four bullet points summarizing the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Apple unveiled the iPhone 16 series at its annual keynote event, featuring a redesigned camera system and AI-powered personal assistant called \"Apple Intelligence\".\n",
      "• The iPhone 16 Pro Max has a new 48-megapixel quad-lens camera with improved night mode and cinematic video stabilization, as well as a 20% increase in battery life compared to the previous model.\n",
      "• Apple emphasized its commitment to privacy by noting that most computations for the AI-powered assistant are performed locally, rather than in the cloud.\n",
      "• The integration of AI tools, such as real-time translation and smart reply generation, signals a new direction for Apple as it competes with Google's Gemini and Samsung’s Galaxy AI, with preorders starting Friday and shipments beginning next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "📄 Summary 3:\n",
      "Here are 4 bullet points summarizing the MIT study:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can boost junior software engineer productivity by up to 40%, making them faster and more confident while reducing stress.\n",
      "• The study found that AI-assisted developers were not only faster but also reported higher confidence in their work, suggesting a positive impact on overall developer well-being.\n",
      "• However, the study also notes that relying solely on AI can introduce subtle bugs in complex logic-heavy scenarios, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and peer review.\n",
      "• The authors conclude that AI should be used as a complement to human expertise rather than a replacement, with combining AI assistance with human peer review being the most effective practice.\n"
