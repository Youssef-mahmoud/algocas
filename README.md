# 🧠 LangChain Learning Tasks for week 3 at AlgoCas Internship

This repository contains a set of hands-on tasks designed to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of **LangChain** — a powerful framework for developing applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). Each task is organized in its own notebook and focuses on a different core concept of the LangChain ecosystem.
